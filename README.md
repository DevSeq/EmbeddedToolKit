<p>ETK is a collection of C++11 classes that a particularly useful in for embedded applications. These classes include wrappers for arrays and C-strings as well as memory pools, smart pointers, ring buffers, a time class (for potentially counting systicks without rollover) and much more. This library exists to help developers write clean, high integrity C++ code without depending on potentially unsafe C functions (such as sprintf).
