A Circular P\-I\-D Controller. This controller uses \hyperlink{namespaceetk_a77f395cb44512ab4a95d08b01b3c7f20}{constrain\-\_\-circular()}; to keep it's inputs and error within a circular range. If segments was set to 360, the setpoint was 175 and the measurement was -\/175, the resulting error would be -\/10 degrees. This makes the circular P\-I\-D controller suitable for controlling the heading of a vehicle, for example.
