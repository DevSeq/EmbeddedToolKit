\subsection{Detailed Description}
W\-H\-Y R\-O\-P\-E? It's like a string, only more robust. 

\hyperlink{class_rope}{Rope} is a C-\/string manipulation class. ` Many C-\/string functions are prohibited by J\-S\-F-\/\-A\-V standard. \hyperlink{class_rope}{Rope} is designed to replace standard C string functions such as strncmp, strcpy and sprintf

It uses pre-\/allocated buffers instead of dynamic memory like std\-::string, so it's relatively safe to use in embedded systems with tight memory constraints.
